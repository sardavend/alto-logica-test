# Sales Receipt Generator

## Solution Approach

The solution is implemented in Ruby, and the input is fed into the solution using standard input. The program reads each line of input, parses the information for each item, and calculates the tax and final price for each item. The total cost and total sales tax are also calculated and displayed on the receipt.


## Usage

To use the solution, simply run the main.rb script in your terminal.
```
ruby main.rb
```

The program will prompt you to enter the item list in the following format:

```
[quantity] [product name] at [price]
```

when you are done with the item list in a new line write `summary` to generate the receipt


## Testing

The program includes base test cases. to run the test write in your terminal:

```
ruby tests/test_order.rb
``
